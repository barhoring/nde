# react-file-browser

A simple, beautiful, file tree view component for React.

## How to Use

Funny thing is... I developed it as part of a big whopping dynamic-loading web browser IDE,
and so I don't have a build system for it yet. It definitely needs
Babel and probably Webpack to load the CSS. Once I make it it's own
package, I'll be able to figure out the build system.

## Credits

- Obviously, the design borrows heavily from [atom/tree-view](https://github.com/atom/tree-view).
- The icons are the fabulous icon set from Atom, packaged up by the author of markdown-browser-plus [websemantics/file-icons-js](https://github.com/websemantics/file-icons-js).
- The CSS is a fork of the CSS used in [websemantics/markdown-browser-plus](https://github.com/websemantics/markdown-browser-plus).
